### **Branches**  

When creating branches, it is recommended to use the appropriate prefix:  

| **Prefix**        | Usage                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`feature/`**    | New functionality                                               |
| **`bugfix/`**     | Bug fix                                                         |
| **`hotfix/`**     | Urgent fix in production                                        |
| **`refactor/`**   | Code refactoring                                                |
| **`docs/`**       | Documentation changes                                          |
| **`test/`**       | Tests and test fixes                                            |
| **`chore/`**      | Minor changes, e.g., configuration, dependency updates          |
| **`release/`**    | Preparing a version for release                                |
| **`experiment/`** | Experimental changes that may not be merged into the main branch |
| **`ci/`**         | Changes in CI/CD configuration                                 |  

This approach helps with:  
- categorizing branches,  
- using additional tools that operate directly on the code in the version control system,  
- CI/CD tools.
